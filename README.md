# COBEN Calculator

This is a COBEN calculator made with [Mavo](https://mavo.io), bundled with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org). I'm using these two tools for the learning experience.

## Isn't there another one?

I do know about [DocDesk's COBEN calculator](https://doc671.web.app/COBEN/). My calculator is designed with the following goals in mind:

- Easy mass data entry
- Systematic calculation
- Mobile friendliness
- Any number of decimal places
- JSON I/O
