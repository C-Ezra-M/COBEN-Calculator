# COBEN Calculator

This is a COBEN calculator made with [Mavo](https://mavo.io), bundled with [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org). I'm using these two tools for the learning experience.

## Isn't there another one?

I do know about [DocDesk's COBEN calculator](https://doc671.web.app/COBEN/). My calculator is designed with the following goals in mind:

- Easy mass data entry
- Systematic calculation
- Mobile friendliness
- Any number of decimal places
- JSON I/O

## Notice about Mavo source code

The Mavo source code is included within this repository because it isn't pulled from the upstream Mavo repository. Instead, it contains [a fix](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/pull/1025/commits/8276e86647300911369fc0b1b63977157add8d66), referenced in [mavoweb/mavo#1025](https://github.com/mavoweb/mavo/pull/1025).
